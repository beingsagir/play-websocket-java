    <p>The Reactive Stocks application has been created!</p>

    <h2>Explore the App</h2>

    <p>
        Once the application has been compiled and the server started, your application can be accessed at: <a href="http://localhost:9000" target="_blank">http://localhost:9000</a><br/>
        Check in <a href="#run" class="shortcut">Run</a> to see the server status.<br/>
        <br/>
        The first thing you will see are three stock charts which are being pushed values in real-time from the server.  These values are simulated so the application always has interesting data flowing in real-time.  Clicking on a stock chart will fetch recent news mentioning the stock symbol, use a service to do sentiment analysis on each news, and then display a buy, sell, or hold recommendation based on the aggregate sentiments.  New stocks can be added to the list using the form in the header.

    <h2>Reactive Apps</h2>

    <p>
        As <a href="http://www.reactivemanifesto.org" target="_blank">The Reactive Manifesto</a> outlines, Reactive apps are Resilient, Interactive, Scalable, and Event-Driven.  The Reactive Stocks application has all of these characteristics because it is built using the Typesafe Platform, including Play Framework for the web interface and Akka for managing concurrency, scalability and fault-tolerance.  Play and Akka support both Scala and Java.  This template showcases Java 8.  Any piece written in Java could also have been written in Scala.  The front-end uses HTML, LESS (compiled to CSS), and CoffeeScript (compiled to JavaScript).  WebSockets are used to push data in real-time from the server to the client.<br/>
        <br/>
        The Reactive Stocks application showcases four types of Reactive: Reactive Push, Reactive Requests, Reactive Composition, and Reactive UIs.  Two types of Reactive which are not directly used in this application are Reactive Pull and 2-way Reactive.  In a real stock feed application, the stock stream would be attached to an actual stock feed service using Reactive Pull.  Those values would then be pushed to the client using Reactive Push.  The combination of Reactive Push &amp; Reactive Pull is 2-way Reactive.  Play's internal network handling is 2-way Reactive.

    <h2>Reactive Push</h2>

    <p>
        This application uses a WebSocket to push data to the browser in real-time.  To create a WebSocket connection in Play, first a route must be defined in the <a href="#code/conf/routes" class="shortcut">routes</a> file.  Here is the route which will be used to setup the WebSocket connection:<br/>
<pre><code>GET /ws controllers.Application.ws</code></pre>
        The <code>ws</code> method in the <a href="#code/app/controllers/Application.java" class="shortcut">Application.java</a> controller handles the request and does the protocol upgrade to the WebSocket connection.  This method create a new <code>UserActor</code> defined in <a href="#code/app/actors/UserActor.java" class="shortcut">UserActor.java</a> (<a href="#code/test/actors/UserActorTest.java" class="shortcut">tests</a>).  The <code>UserActor</code> stores the handle to the WebSocket connection.<br/>
        <br/>
        Once the <code>UserActor</code> is created, the default stocks (defined in <a href="#code/conf/application.conf" class="shortcut">application.conf</a>) are added to the user's list of watched stocks.<br/>
        <br/>
        Each stock symbol has its own <code>StockActor</code> defined in <a href="#code/app/actors/StockActor.java" class="shortcut">StockActor.java</a> (<a href="#code/test/actors/StockActorTest.java" class="shortcut">tests</a>).  This actor holds the last 50 prices for the stock.  The initial history is sent to watchers.  A <code>Stock.Latest</code> message will generate a new price using the <code>newPrice</code> method in the <a href="#code/app/utils/FakeStockQuote.java" class="shortcut">FakeStockQuote.java</a> file.  Every <code>StockActor</code> sends itself a <code>Stock.Latest</code> message every 75 milliseconds.  Once a new price is generated it is added to the history and then a message is sent to each <code>UserActor</code> that is watching the stock.  The <code>UserActor</code> then serializes the data as JSON and pushes it to the client using the WebSocket.<br/>
        <br/>
        Underneath the covers, resources (threads) are only allocated to the Actors and WebSockets when they are needed.  This is why Reactive Push is scalable with Play and Akka.
    </p>

    <h2>Reactive UI - Real-time Chart</h2>

    <p>
        On the client-side a Reactive UI updates the stock charts every time a message is received.  The <a href="#code/app/views/index.scala.html" class="shortcut">index.scala.html</a> file produces the web page at <a href="http://localhost:9000">http://localhost:9000</a> and loads the JavaScript and CSS needed render the page and setup the UI.<br/>
        <br/>
        The JavaScript for the page is compiled from the <a href="#code/app/assets/javascripts/index.coffee" class="shortcut">index.coffee</a> file which is written in CoffeeScript (an elegant way to write JavaScript).  Using jQuery, a page ready handler sets up the WebSocket connection and sets up functions which will be called when the server sends a message to the client through the WebSocket:
<pre><code>$ ->
  ws = new WebSocket $("body").data("ws-url")
  ws.onmessage = (event) ->
    message = JSON.parse event.data</code></pre>
        The message is parsed and depending on whether the message contains the stock history or a stock update, a stock chart is either created or updated.  The charts are created using the <strong>Flot</strong> JavaScript charting library.  Using CoffeeScript, jQuery, and Flot makes it easy to build Reactive UI in the browser that can receive WebSocket push events and update the UI in real-time.

    <h2>Inspect the App</h2>

    <p>
        Use <a href="#inspect" class="shortcut">Inspect</a> to see the requests that have been handled by the running Play application and to see the Akka Actors (if any) in the Actor System.  Drilling down into an individual request will provide details about the request.  Drilling down into an individual Actor will display a number of statistics and information about the Actor.  Deviations will show you any issues with your Actors.
